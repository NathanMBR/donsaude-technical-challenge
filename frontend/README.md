# donsaude-technical-challenge - Frontend

This folder contains the code for the Frontend side of the challenge.

## About decisions and difficulties
In this section, I will talk more about the decisions I made and the difficulties I had during the development of the frontend.

### Difficulties
I had two difficulties with the frontend: lack of experience and time. Knowing that I have more ease with the backend, I started with it, and used most of the time to make it very well done. But I had little experience of personal projects with the frontend, and none professionally. Combine this with the lack of time (it was already on the penultimate day when I started it) and you can understand why the interface is not finished.

### Architecture
I chose a simple architecture, as I already had little time to spare.

### Technologies
These are the used technologies and its reasons:

- TypeScript (Type-safety)
- React (Requested in the project specifications, as well as being the largest library for the frontend)
- Tailwind (Modern way of writing CSS)
- Zod (Typescript-first validation that can be reutilized in frontend)
- Hookform (Easy form validation)
- Eslint (Codebase maintainability and standardization)
- Docker (Easy environment setup)
